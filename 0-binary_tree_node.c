/**
 * binary_tree_node - Creates a new node for a binary tree.
 *
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node of the created one.
 * @value: Value to store inside the created node.
 *
 *
 * Description - This function takes two arguments; a pointer to a structure
 *               which will be the parent node of the created node, if the
 *               parent value is NULL, that means the created node will be the
 *               root, and thus the starting point of a new tree.
 *
 *
 * Return: â†’ Address to the new node on success.
 *         â†’ NULL on failure.
